# OHCS (Overhead Charging System) Simulation Project

## 🔧 Project Overview
The **OHCS Project** (Overhead Hoist Charging System) is an autonomous charging platform for electric vehicles (EVs), simulated in a virtual environment using **Gazebo** and **ROS Noetic**.

Our system moves a charger along ceiling-mounted rails toward a parked EV based on user position input. Once the vehicle is fully charged, the system **automatically detaches** the charger. Charger attachment must be done manually for now.

Future expansion includes **manipulator arm integration** for fully automated charging.

## 🧠 Project Goals
- Develop a simulation model of OHCS in a 3D environment using **Gazebo**.
- Design a rail-based EV charger transport mechanism.
- Implement autonomous detachment logic upon full charge.
- Support for future manipulator extension to achieve full automation.
- Evaluate multi-user scalability and spatial task scheduling.

## 📅 Timeline
- **Start**: March 2025  
- **End**: June 2025
